gene-trend
==========

This project is designed to answer the following questions:

* Which gene is the hottest in the last year?
* How does the degree of a gene's hotness change over time?
* Who contributes most to a gene's function discovery?
* How is the research on one gene linked to its function?

The origin data are either downloaded from [NCBI FTP site][ncbi_ftp] or fetched
using NCBI's [Entrez Direct][edirect] toolkit. Data analysis will be mainly
performed on the [R][R] programming environment.
